Everything the Regime had thrown at them, everything they had done to sabotage the inevitable march of the Movement, and they had won. They flipped through the channels; the worldwide right was declaring victory everywhere.<br><br>In Germany, in Canada, in France, all of them had cruised to victory. This victory wasn’t just in America, it was worldwide. The entire year, every single left-wing government kicked out, or replaced by populist progressives aligned with the anti-Regime-ian cause. On the TVs were the media pundits, and lost reporters of mainstream media, pouting in bitter defeat, howling to the sky above how much they despised this world, how much they despised the voters. Yet no one was listening, not anymore.<br><br>“Can you believe it?” a young man shouted, wearing an American flag hat and an all-American outfit, grabbing a nearby young woman, decked out in sunglasses and a scarf, red, white, and blue, the love of his life. “We won!” He bent down and kissed her, she kissed him back. “We won we won we won!”<br><br>The scarlet red map stared back at them, smiling like a jubilant grin, smiling from sea to shining sea. Their victory, their final victory, a stunning rebuke and final defeat of their greatest enemy. Victory was theirs, all theirs. Across the world, from India, to England, to France, to Germany, the entire global anti-globalist movement, they were smiling at them. The world had watched as America had landed the final blow. They were free. The monster had been slain.<br><br>The Regime was defeated, shattered and left in shambles. And it was like the sky lifted over them, the nightly stars emerging overhead. Never could they have imagined such wide horizons, such open possibilities. When the forces that conspired to keep them down were at long last, cast back into the depths of hell.<br><br>Already the political pundits were panicking, trying to look for any silver lining in this living catastrophe. But there was none. A new generation was coming of age, one which was known to be heavily conservative, raised in right wing families, educated by the internet, and deeply skeptical of the bureaucracy above.<br><br>The left was a dying demographic, and each year, they would only recede further and further from the reins of power. The Democratic Party was already being reorganized, taken over with help from the Movement, with new candidate Tulsi Gabbard already the favored candidate to take over the party in 2036, and her promise to “bring back common sense to the left”. That was why she had left, she was preparing a hostile takeover of the machinery of the machine. It would be years before the left could be assimilated back into the ideals of the Movement, but that was help the Movement was willing to help provide.<br><br>Vance was already on TV, all of the channels and all of the broadcasts. Listing out his agenda for the next 4 years, a full bureaucratic purge, installing truly patriotic education, promoting cohesive families and cohesive communities, and promoting true meritocracy and competition at all levels. Both in government, and across society. With both House and Senate deeply in the GOP’s control, nothing seemed off limits, it was truly 1776 all over again.<br><br>Flipping through the channels, Germany was raising up the German flags throughout its streets again, France was proud to announce it was French again. All over the world, the people were raising their flags. They reveled in their distinctiveness and celebrated what made them unique. Proud of their cultures, loving of their people. The international alliance of nationalists, the beautiful tapestry of thousands of millennia-old beautiful cultures had won. They were free to be free, free to be the greatest and most beautiful versions of themselves, without any shame, guilt, or regret. And they sang praises to God (or gods) above. Oh, how they had won.<br><br>Night bled into day, day bled into night, and the celebration continued, and from the skies above, the stars came into view. Twinkling, sparkling little angels inviting them into a bright new tomorrow. They saw there America’s future, and they saw there, humanity’s future.<br><br>A great American flag flew over them, seemingly thanking the people below for the liberation it now felt. It waved to the people below, and the people below waved back, and the people below celebrated some more in a sea of red, white, and blue.<br><br>Tomorrow, there would be much work to do. The engine of the world still had to be run, and the problems of the world still had to be fixed. But today, today was a day for celebration. For today was the jubilant triumph history would forever remember.</p>`,

Watching as the votes came in, and the map glowed a shade of crimson red, it felt like the entire world was about to change. They didn’t just have a victory, they had a mandate. A blank cheque from the American people to do as they pleased. As victories continued to roll in, in both the House and the Senate, it continued. Despite everything the Regime had thrown at them, they had won in a landslide. And at the center of it all was JD Vance, a cheerful smile on his face, and a piece of paper in his hands.<br><br>“Ladies and Gentlemen,” he said, beads of sweat running down as he stared into the eye of the hot spotlights. “We are back. Thank you so much for 4 more years.”<br><br>The stadium erupted, he could feel its energy, the roaring excitement that shook the ground like an earthquake. He had mobilized something truly powerful.

To quote one of the great presidents of the past 50 years, Ronald Reagan… Let history say of us: These were golden years--when the American Revolution was reborn, when freedom gained new life, and America reached for her best.”<br><br>The crowd began to cheer. “4 more years! 4 more years!”<br><br>“When you wake up tomorrow, this is what I want you to do.

But at the end of the day, that’s not the only battle. There’s another battle, a more important one being waged on the ground with you.<br><br>The battle that is fought every day with the actions we do and the work we show. And we show ourselves as Americans through our kindness, and our actions, being graceful even after glorious victory. As the people who dream big, who expect the best out of everyone, who aren’t afraid of exposing the contours of our soul, who shake the earth and reach out for the heavens above. We are a people who has declared that nothing is impossible.

Though they had seen a last-minute poll surge, it wasn’t enough. Losing by narrow margins in the undecided states, the Regime had decisively defeated them. Staring down the forces of the Regime, the Movement charged, against the dying of the light.<br><br>Yet Vance didn’t seem discouraged, on his face was something else. Determination. He had led them competently, with everything the Regime had thrown at him, he still managed to keep his head above thrashing waves. If anything, the entire situation was giving the Movement flashbacks to 2020. He stood at the podium, sweat beads rolling down his face, the spotlight in his eyes, staring down the sea that he had channeled.<br><br>“My fellow Americans,” he began to say. “This fight is not over. The Regime has thrown everything they can at us, funnelled their worldwide resources against us. But we’re still standing. The entire field was stacked against us, they spent everything they had crushing us to dust, but we’re still standing.<br><br>This is a setback, not a defeat. Look at what they had to sacrifice to break us. Look at Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom. They had to retreat from all of them. They couldn’t hold us all down at once. So, they let them go. We endured so other countries may be free.”<br><br>Vance began to laugh, maniacally, on the edge of control. “All the resources in the world, and all they could do is knock us down to 200 something EVs. That’s pathetic, really. And they had to sacrifice their entire global empire for this. Facing against the resources of the entire world, and they couldn’t destroy us.”<br><br>He paused. “In 4 years, we will be stronger, and they will be weaker. I didn’t say they were the party of childless cat ladies for no reason, their biological clock is tick, tick, ticking down. Tomorrow we will return better, become stronger, bringing our children to the polling booth with us, and we will return as many times as it takes, until they are defeated. We have a future; they don’t. We will defeat them; we will replace them.<br><br>We did it once, staged the greatest comeback in American history. Well, I’m ready to continue fighting for you, and do it one more time. I hereby announce my intention to run in the 2036 presidential elections. I didn’t think I would still be running in 2036, but you have to take what life throws at you sometimes.”<br><br>The crowd began to cheer. “4 more years! 4 more years!”<br><br>“When you wake up tomorrow, this is what I want you to do. Go to work, hug your family, be the best American you can. Love thy neighbor, even if they’re a Democrat. Because the Movement isn’t inside me, or inside the Republican Party. No, it’s in all of you, the American people. If we have to go dormant for another 4 years, then that’s what we’ll have to do. But at the end of the day, we’re still fighting for America, America the beautiful. And we show ourselves as Americans through our kindness, and our actions, being graceful even after bitter loss. And we will reconvene 4 years from now, and take back the White House, one more time.”<br><br>And there was cheering. Even in defeat, morale was high.

The Regime had thrown everything they could at them, and they had crushed them. Vance had been sacked almost immediately, now many of the Movement Faithful believing he was a double agent meant to sabotage the entire Movement. As Newsom appeared on the great screen above them, announcing with his monotone, demonic voice a return to normalcy, the air of dread couldn’t help but hang in the room around them.<br><br>Many of them had families, several had businesses that had finally began to thrive under the Vance administration, and now were sent kicking and screaming back to square one. They didn’t want to think how they would survive, when the Regime seemed determined to regulate them out of existence. The map was a sea of dark blue, of the primordial darkness engulfing America.<br><br>And then came a feeling in the air, determination. Even as America is about to spiral into its darkest hour, they would not give up. Throughout hard work and dedication, they had built up the most robust movement ever created on the right. And they had lost, when the Regime had thrown everything, it could at them, they wouldn’t be so scared if they weren’t a threat.<br><br>And though it would be another dark 4 years before the emergence of another shot. And it wasn’t all dark. Throughout the world, governments left and right had been toppled by the Movements of their respective countries. The AfD stormed their way into power, Reform looked on the verge of victory. Everywhere they looked, the Regime was in retreat, everywhere but America. Perhaps in another 4 years, they could assist them take back their homeland.<br><br>The regime had thrown everything they could at them, and while it was enough, the Movement refused to stop fighting. For they knew the Regime’s days, even with this temporary victory, was numbered. Demographics was destiny, and the Regime was operating on a clock that was tick, tick, ticking down.

She could hardly believe it, after all of the struggle, all of that time. She had… Won.<br><br>She looked down at the now limp and defeated body of Reaction. Reform, the AfD, the MAGA movement… It was all gone, they seemingly collapsed over a matter of only a few months. Collapsing to the ground in exhaustion, she could hardly believe it. She didn’t know how, she didn’t know why Reaction suddenly collapsed like that, what happened to “the Movement” as Reaction so liked to call himself, or how she had pulled it off, when everything had been stacked against her.<br><br>She reminisced back to her long fight with Reaction. His dark, sinister plans to dismantle democracy, how he disregarded the tenements of science and truth, and how he planned to bring fascism and anarchy against her rightful rule… But now, it was finally over.<br><br>She stared up into the ethereal sky, just contemplating how something like this could happen so fast. Looking up at the light beaming in, she wondered if it was divine intervention that had pulled this off. It had to be. But in the end, what happened had happened, her position at the throne of the world was safe once again.<br><br>Looking down from the ethereal realm, back into the realm of men, where she felt her energy course through the minds of her people, the world began to heal. The cycles of history had finally been stopped. With no opposing force, the tides of the world were hers to command again. And now, under her omnibenevolent rule, she can go back to bringing about the end of history.<br><br>Let the world run like clockwork, let the warmth of progress melt the borders of man’s heart, and let everyone frolick in the utopia she will build. This world was hers again, each person in their place, not a single puzzle piece out of order. And as everyone played the ever-spiralling song of progress, everything was right with the world.<br><br>And this song of progress would continue forever and ever and ever. Until the stars grow cold and the Earth grows wild. There would be no more conflict, no more property to fight over. There will only be happiness from now on.</p>`,

The beginning, known as “the Great Decoupling,” saw the splintering of much of the world into Western, Chinese, and eventually Indian trade blocs.<br><br>Economists and geopolitical experts have long stated that the reasoning behind the Great Uncoupling was rising hostility between rival powers, the rush to secure nationally important resources, and a fear of supply chain fragility, first proven with the COVID-19 pandemic shocks. Countries have been moving away from a global free trade system in exchange for rising protectionism.<br><br>However, with a new trade agreement signed by President JD Vance, and tentative agreements to slowly reopen trading relations between the United States and China, economists state that the trend of deglobalization may be reversing, welcome news to economies of the Global South, which had been stuck in a stagnatory rut since the Great Uncoupling. Vance’s actions were met with criticism from labor unions and American manufacturers, who are expected to protest outside the White House later this week.<br><br>That said, stock markets seemed receptive to the news, with the DOW Jones rising significantly since the announcement, and American GDP growth was last recorded at 2.6% in the last quarter of 2025. Economists say many businesses are eager to take advantage of new opportunities and are excited for the prospect of gaining access to a new billion strong customer base.<br><br>That said, geopolitical analysts have warned about the risks of increasing global trade, warning that over-connectedness to the global economy increases the fragility of the entire system. And with deep underlying tensions between the major powers still not resolved, that this could result in compromises in national security, and grows only more risky as global tensions continue to rise.</p>`,

The war began over disputed territory in Eastern Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin breaking the 2025 Ukrainian ceasefire after 4 years of ceasefire. The conflict has since then become a larger proxy battle between the members of the European Union, and the Russian Federation.<br><br>The war has been notable for the extensive usage of mercenaries, the rising influence of non-state actors, and the meteoric rise of private military corporations contracted for the conflict. Currently, none of the European nations have committed their armed forces in the defense of Ukraine, instead relying on defense contractors and private military corporations (PMCs) to do the fighting on their behalf. These PMCs are known to recruit from all over the world, with soldiers primarily drawing from economically depressed regions such as Brazil, Turkey, and the Middle East.<br><br>On top of that, various militias and ideological groups have also put forth their own fighters for the operation, many non-state militias such as the Antifascist Coalition, Pan-Europa, and PMC Goldwater have also made their way into the region, gaining valuable military experience, and offering their services to anyone who can pay. Many have called this style of fighting “the future of warfare” and many experts expect the influence of these non-state actors to only increase going into the future.<br><br>The United States has officially stayed neutral in the conflict, though providing weapons sales and allowing their own citizens to begin organizing militias. American oil shipments have singlehandedly kept the European economy afloat and has been their primary energy supplier ever since the Russian oil embargo of 2031. The war gets little domestic attention however, as American politicians tend to be far more focused on the Pacific confrontation with China.<br><br>In economic news, in spite of soaring oil sales, coinciding with the European winter season, both the American and Chinese economies have been stuck in a stagnatory rut ever since the start of the Great Uncoupling. The United States has been averaging between 1% growth for the past 2 years, with China stagnating around 0% growth.<br><br>Economists say the American economy has been stifled by rising grocery prices, sluggish global economic conditions, and an uncompetitive manufacturing sector shielded and subsidized through protectionist measures. While the Chinese economy is reeling from the shadow of its property crisis, aging population, rising youth unemployment, and rising inflation in a bid to drive spending.<br><br>Both are facing headwinds of a generally gloomy global economic outlook, with aging populations in developed countries, decline in global trade, and industrialization failures in developing countries depressing the world’s economic output.</p>`,

Almost every city in China has become completely consumed by the protests, with the only exception being the capital of Beijing, where routine police crackdowns have continued to keep the peace.<br><br>The protests are an ideologically mixed bunch, a broad coalition of democratic reformers, Han nationalists, and hardline Maoists. But most often, the vast majority of their numbers are simply discontent people who have finally reached the end of their rope. Critics often report the 996 workdays, the rising price of housing, the exceedingly high expectations for schools, the chronic gender imbalance, and difficulty of marriage culture in China as contributing factors to China’s ongoing instability.<br><br>Young men, frustrated by their lack of mobility in the work force, lack of prospects in the dating market, inability to buy a house, and many more have been among the first to take to the streets, and have been joined by an unlikely ally.

Behold, the world you’ve made.<br><br>…<br><br>“Now now, children” a schoolteacher said, her voice assertive and shrill. The kids before her were all girls, donning the bonnet, in matching red dresses. “Please turn your history textbooks to Chapter 23.”<br><br>They opened their leathery books, bound together with sturdy hides. They flipped through its crinkly pages, until they reached it. Chapter 23, “On the mistakes of the 21st century.”<br><br>“Before our country was redeemed. Before it was saved by the hand of God, America was a place of great sin. A despicable place, a wicked place in the eyes of the LORD,” the schoolteacher said.<br><br>And they read about them. Degeneracy, homosexuality, atheism, ideas they had known in theory, but could seldom believe anyone could follow. They saw people clothed, yet unclothed. They saw the stranglehold of media, vast, hollow organizations that brainwashed an entire nation. Polygamy and promiscuity that tore families, and nations apart. They saw postmodern scribes and scholars scratch against the walls of reality, trying to assert that true is false, and false is true, scrabbling to themselves until they could hear reason no more.<br><br>And they saw the hanging fields, where millions took their own life in despair, the void black nihilism that took hold in the absence of God. The regiments, dozens of pills one after another, to sedate and sterilize until they dissolved into their own disorder. And then they turned the page.<br><br>Pages upon pages of gruesome images of dead babies, millions of infants sacrificed to the demons of hell. Women severing children from herself as they were a tumor to be discarded. Piling up so high until their flesh and bones made a horrid pyramid, stretching on against the red dusk.<br><br>One of the girls began to cry and tried to slam the book shut. The teacher reached out with her ruler, and kept the book open. “Look at it. This is the sin which our country has wrought. The work of the so called “progressives”. These are the sins which our country is recovering from.”<br><br>The girl stared back at the image of the fetus staring back at her, and placed her hand on the page, as if to comfort these still images. Many of them had baby siblings, they imagined them, their flesh and body parts mangled beyond belief, as they had seen in these horrible images.<br><br>“America was sinful, but with help from the Holy Evangelical Church of America, the nation been redeemed. The church was instrumental in purging America of secular ideas, and returning America to the way of the Lord. The images you see show the importance of Christian values. Destruction and devastation awaits all who go against it,” the schoolteacher said, her voice full of venom. “Inclusion, equity, empowerment, all ideas so tempting, so simple. But you know what they always say. Lucifer wasn’t called tempting for no reason.”<br><br>One of the girls spoke up, her voice stammering, almost too shaken to speak.<br><br>“Yes?” the schoolteacher asked.<br><br>“T-t-these progressives… What are they?” the girl asked.<br><br>“They were a different religious faith, but without the belief in the supernatural. We used to call them… Ideology. They believed that they were arbiters of moral progress, that their teachings were infallible, and with the guidance of their moral teachings, humanity would progress towards utopia,” the schoolteacher replied.<br><br>“So, not so different from us,” one of the braver girls asked. The class looked at her stunned. She had a habit of speaking out of turn.<br><br>“… Yes,” the schoolteacher replied, after a moment of silence.<br><br>“What makes them different?”<br><br>“They were wrong, and we are right,” the schoolteacher replied simply. “They worshipped false gods, we worship the true God. They were fooled by a trick of Lucifer they called “progress”. Do not worry about such wicked things. Our progress is not theirs.”<br><br>“And where are they now?” the girl asked.<br><br>“They are nearly extinct,” the schoolteacher replied. “They destroyed themselves in life, and now they destroy themselves in death. The last ones are now passing away. Nature will punish them in life, and God will punish them in the afterlife.”<br><br>The schoolteacher looked at her watch.<br><br>“Class is almost over. Please stand for the pledge of allegiance.”<br><br>The girls all stood up in unison. Their eyes loyal, their minds diligent, they looked naught but up, at the cross that hung above the classroom. They had no thoughts but their devotion.<br><br>“I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of Ameirca,<br><br>And to the Republic for which it stands,<br><br>One nation under Christ, redeemed by His blood,<br><br>With obedience, righteousness, and justice for all.<br><br><br>I vow to uphold His divine law,<br><br>To walk in the path of the Lord,<br><br>And to defend His truth against all ungodliness.<br><br>May His will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven,<br><br>Forever and ever. Amen.”<br><br>And the pastoral fields stretch far away, as the world returned to tradition and soul. The spires of the New System, double spirals stretching out from the ground, spiraling up until it touched the sky itself, forming the symbol of a cross. The Universalist Guardians of new Progress would guide the sheep to utopia. The linear arc of justice, leading them to the End of History.<br><br>And unlike those who tried before, this time they would do it right.</p>`,

Behold, the world you’ve made.<br><br>…<br><br>Below the Blinding Lights of the Cathedral, Nick toiled. The world was accelerating ahead, and if he couldn’t prove his worth to the system, the system would cast him out, just like so many of those before him. He sat in a room with ten thousand other students, all diligently scribbling away at the examinations below them. His hand shook with uncertainty. Charting equations, drawing graphs, trying to justify why he should be allowed to join the ranks of the anointed.<br><br>Beads of sweat formed on his head, above all, he blamed himself. The system was fair, the system was just, it was him who failed. He hadn’t worked diligently enough, he hadn’t studied hard enough, maybe his genetics were just bad. It was his fault, it was his fault, it was his fault. Struggling, his pencil now wobbling, he continued to fill in the boxes, answer essays and draw out his designs. The exam was entering its 4th hour now.<br><br>The screens watched him, the smooth white walls and ceiling formed a pyramid, with the blinding light from above watching down on him, casting down judgement from above. Question 35. Solve the following matrix problems. Question 36, use your knowledge to streamline the following supply chains.<br><br>Meritocracy. That was the promise of the New System, ever since their Founding Fathers had built the New Havens. One test, one standard, fair and equal before all. For the low price of only a 1/60th of his current salary, you were given the chance to prove yourself and rise to the upper ranks. There were those rose by doing, and those who rose by studying, those who did neither, were deemed worthless.<br><br>Question 51, the test was entering its 5th hour now. The maintenance of your life is an active detriment to society around you. One day, you would have to give back to society an equal or greater amount compared to what it gave you, you were born in debt. Life on the higher levels, it was a dream that Nick only seldom contemplated, being deemed a contributor, rather than just a neutral, passively treading water. It would not be here where Nick would prove himself, it would have to be there, at the upper levels.<br><br>The test had ended, the students lined up, to pass in their examinations one by one. A scanner laid at the front. Nick had pulled himself back in the final hours, sweat forming on his face, he had a chance, just a chance to succeed. The scanner was efficient, able to tell you whether you had succeeded or failed right then and there. A trickle of students, triumphant or dejected, slowly exited the building, as the line led Nick closer and closer. Though many of them had failed this time around, they would have a chance to try again next year, after they paid the entrance fee again. The System was fair, the System was Just.<br><br>Finally, it was his turn. He handed over his papers, nervous hands trembling.<br><br>“Nick Turner,” the scanner chimed. “Subject, Computer Science and Supply Chain Management. Grading…”<br><br>The scanner only worked for a few seconds, but within those few seconds, Nick’s life had been forever altered.<br><br>“Final grade: 63%. Welcome to the upper levels. You are now a CONTRIBUTOR. Auction initiated for Nick Turner…”<br><br>The machine whirred, doubtless, on the other end, automated algorithms were whirring, bartering with offer and counteroffer for his experience. “You have, 5 initiation offers. 3 for, Junior Data Verifier, 2 for, Junior AI Overseer. You are free to accept or reject all initiation offers. Thank you for studying with us.”<br><br>Nick grabbed his papers and resisted the urge to hug the robotic scanner before him. Finally, he would be considered a net contributor to society.<br><br>This was the happiest day in his entire life.</p>`,

The Populists were utterly dominant in the new coalition, and they would come to shape the world in their image alone. And the choices you made set it on a path yet unseen. Behold, the world you’ve made.<br><br>…<br><br>It was a good day for Ron Ford. To be born in America, the greatest country to have ever been made. He saw the raggedy old flag that hung in his apartment, Old Glory, and an image of Uncle Sam, staring at him resolutely. He saluted them. As he exited his musty apartment, and went downstairs to the doors outside, he noticed a few of the lightbulbs weren’t up to snuff. He scoffed, some more local administrators skimming money from the top, a socialist, no doubt. How dare they tarnish the name of America, he’s sure that the good, patriotic people at the top will punish them soon enough.<br><br>Walking down the streets below, he was greeted by posters, touting proud, patriotic broadcasting. “Under America, you have higher wages”, “Under America, you have lower taxes”, “Under America, your rights are non-negotiable”, and “Under America, you are safe from violence.”<br><br>A great billboard hung over them. “Freedom is paramount, Patriotism is Non-Negotiable. Glory to America, glory to the American people.” And he saluted, the patriotism making him teary eyed inside. Images of Uncle Sam telling the American people to work harder for the national spirit, Feminine images of Feminine Columbia asking her fellow Americans to cut down on electricity consumption.<br><br>A burly photo of Teddy Roosevelt calling on Americans to consume less, to save the pristine beauty of America, with an image of the scenery of a national park right behind him. Ron agreed immediately, and vowed he would do his part to conserve the beauty of America. He would from here on out, eschew plastic wrappers, consume less, and do his best to preserve the beauty of lady America.<br><br>And then he saw a hot dog stand, next to a poster that read “VICTORY DOGS, the purchase of every VICTORY DOG helps our American boys keep us safe in Europe.” He walked over, paying for the victory dog with his cash, and scarfing it down in a matter of seconds. He threw the waxy paper wrapping into a nearby trash can, happy he was doing his part to win the war against those damned commie Europeans.<br><br>As he passed by several more posters, he felt a litany of emotions pour through him. “Defend Western Civilization, Protect the Gays from Muslim Barbarians!” he read, and felt a righteous indignation against the Islamic barbarians of the Middle East, harassing those who were just trying to live their lives. Then “European schools teach LGBT propaganda at their schools, put an end to them,” and another bout of rage. Is nothing sacred? He was glad that their righteous military was bombing the crap out of those degenerate perverts.<br><br>Finally, a picture of Uncle Sam, holding a big symbol of peace. “The United States stands for peace.” Damn straight, Ron thought, what goes on in the rest of the world is none of our business.<br><br>And then, he saw a crowd gathering around someone. It was that damned local administrator, he thought. He was skimming money off the top like the rest of those damned socialist saboteurs, he thought. He butt his way into the crowd, ready to give him a piece of his mind, when he heard:<br><br>“So, I need you, all of you here to elect me for 4 more years. To prevent those filthy degenerates from getting a hold of your kids. To hang all of those damned communists and damn socialists. So I can get you higher wages and lower taxes. I fight for you! The common working people, against the nefarious global elite, who would have this beautiful country trampled underfoot. God bless America, who here is with me?”<br><br>And there was a cheer out from the crowd. Ron smiled, he was mistaken, this was no socialist, he was a patriotic, beautiful, red-blooded Democrat, just like the other administrators in this city.

	"truly_free": `<h3>Land of the Truly Free</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>Out here, nothing really bothered us. Our ancestors were free people of the soil, and now after the reforms of the past few years, we were free people of the soil again. Our old farm was acting up, too many bugs. So, they sprayed everything with some good old-fashioned pesticides. Ain’t no government needed to get involved, and everything was fine again.<br><br>They lived by their own rules, old pa said you ought to respect everyone’s honor and don’t get too caught up in other people’s business. Because there was nothing more dangerous than a man who felt disrespected. Every once in a while, a little man from the big city would come crawling up to us, must’ve come from the state capital in Lincoln. I always remembered the way he dressed, fancy suit and tie, so worried about getting some dirty on it. He’d ramble on and on how we’re not following this regulation and that regulation and try to impose some order on the place. But none of the big families will budge, and as soon as he’s gone, we go back to the way things used to do.<br><br>Pa says cities used to interfere with us a lot more, now they don’t interfere too much. People say we needs a government to fend against those who mess with us. Well, John Deere tried to mess with us, tinkering with their intellectual property, or whatnot. They sent their lawyers, but we fended them off with our rifles just fine. They forgot to live by the law of the land. Out here, everyone is free. <br><br>I met a girl from that farm yonder, real nice. I loved her and she loved me, and we’s got married, and ain’t a single bureaucrat need to be involved, just the way it should be.<br><br>The land isn’t quite as fertile as it used to be. The soil has begun sloping downwards, and our crop yields ain’t as good as they used to be. But we just add more fertilizers and pesticides, and things go back to normal again. The roads also ain’t maintained so well, I feel the bumps every time we take our produce to market. But it’s okay, if the big suits ain’t fixing the roads for us, we’ll simply fix them ourselves.<br><br>Uncle Jack grew up in the cities, said that the big city people would always attract homeless people, poor wretched men who parasitize off the backs of others. They say they don’t do that so much anymore, since the government’s weak. That wouldn’t fly out here. Out here, you’re here to fend for yourself. You have to be strong, or you have to be worm food. The community will help ya so much, but, you have to start carrying your own weight at some point. Ain’t enough wealth to go around otherwise.<br><br>I love America. The land of open days and open skies. The place where you can be free, where man can live in the natural way God intended them to live. Hard-working, self-reliant, free. They say there are other countries out there, but America is already so big. I dunno what other countries could possibly look like.</p>`,
	
	"the_road_ahead":`<h3>The Road Ahead</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>The effects of the Victory of the New Right in the 2032 election were instrumental to the world we would inhabit today. The Vance presidency would be characterized by an cutting down on government waste, extensive cuts to the federal bureaucracy, and its final replacement by a more ideologically loyal regime. The reduction in competition, both in decreased immigration, stagnation in working age population, and increased productivity from deregulation saw the fastest real wage growth since the 1970’s, though this was not without its critics. Particularly from women’s rights activists.<br><br>The administration was notable for passing many socially conservative reforms, including the rollback of transgender rights, further tightening of abortion restrictions, election integrity reforms, and the repeal of various workplace anti-discrimination laws. Despite much pressure from the Christian Right, Obergefell managed to remain intact despite a 7-2 Conservative Supreme Court.<br><br>In foreign policy, Vance increased pressure on the People’s Republic, between putting harsh trade sanctions, and the creation of Association of Consumption-Led Countries. The ACLC was a bloc of the world’s largest net importers, at a time when nearly everyone was shifting towards exports with aging demographics, and used the bargaining power of the American consumption base as a heavy bargaining chip to leverage during trade negotiations.<br><br>Vance’s policies would largely be continued during the Gabbard Presidency, from 2036 to 2044. Her presidency would center around the further purging of government waste, with particular focus being put on the Department of Defense. She also initiated large-scale redistribution schemes, assisted by influential members such as Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and broke up various tech trusts across her tenure. This combination of rising wages and breakup of capital resulted in the mid-century economic golden age.<br><br>Looking back on the Vance, and later Gabbard presidencies, we can see the foundations of the modern world we live in today being built, with many of their policies forming what we today know as “Neo-Populism”, and the transition away from the 6th Party System into the 7th. Today, experts believe we may be entering into the 8th Party System, as “New Liberalism” begins emerging in the Republican Party, with its focus on automation, decentralization, and free trade, and Neo-Populism remains the status quo of liberal Democrats.</p>`,

	"reconquista": `<h3>How Conservative Christians plan on Retaking the Mainline Churches | Christianity Today</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>Every day, Christian churches continue to close, across America’s city centers, the sight of a once essential bedrock of the community being boarded up and shuttered is not an uncommon sight. However, what is often seen as a tragedy by many is seen as opportunity by others.<br><br>The most prominent of these is conservative Christian Richard Ackerman, better known by his online handle, “Redeemed Zoomer”, who has been working on taking over what he calls “liberal mainline churches” and returning them to what he calls “Biblically sound Christianity.” He leads a community of just over 3 million followers, and has been outspoken about the need to retake the mainline churches.<br><br>“The plan is simple, really. The mainline churches are dying out. You go there and it’s a retirement home. There’s no one there but a couple grandmas playing bingo or something. But these churches have vital historical institutions, historical roots and connections to communities that can’t easily be replaced. The plan is to take these dying old churches, flood them with younger, conservative Christians, and to realign them to Biblically sound Christianity.”<br><br>Operation Reconquista has already succeeded in taking over several mainline denominations, most prominently leading to a conservative takeover of the PCUSA over the past few years. With others such as the United Methodist Church, and the ECLA also reporting a great increase in their conservative membership. When asked how the past few years have looked, Richard seemed to be in relatively upbeat mood.<br><br>“We’re very happy with the progress we have made over the past few years. But the battle is far from won. We never thought this would be a short or simple process. Ultimately, it’s going to be a long, protracted spiritual battle for us to retake the Mainline Churches. The original Reconquista took about 800 years, we’re ready to wait just as long to bring these churches back to Biblically sound teaching. Honestly, I’m just happy that conservatives seem to have woken up to the need to retake institutions, rather than just retreating from them. About 10 years ago, you didn’t see that as much, now everything has changed.”<br><br>When asked why he wants to spend this energy to take over dying mainline denominations, rather than strengthening larger Evangelical denominations, he had this to say.<br><br>“Look, these churches aren’t just pretty buildings. That’s a strawman my opponents will try to paint me with all the time. That I’m just launching this crusade to retake some pretty buildings. No, these institutions have roots and they have a history, their connections to the community are just as important as the congregation itself. These are the institutions that founded Yale and Harvard, we can’t just let them fall by the wayside. Just as Christ believes in redemption, so do I.”<br><br>When asked about non-denominational churches, Ackerman went on a 45-minute diatribe that we have decided not to release in full in this article. When asked for parting words, Ackerman had this to say.<br><br>“Look, so many young Christians these days dream of a crusade. Or of evangelizing in some far off land. But you can do that here, right in your own local neighborhood, having a direct impact on people you meet every day. It’s really easy to get leadership positions in these dying churches, they practically give out leadership positions like candy. They’re just happy young people are finally showing an interest in their church. For a lot of people, this will be the first time they have ever heard the gospel. So if you ever want to go an evangelism mission of your own, there’s no better place to start than the church next door.”</p>`,
	
	"gabbard": `<h3>Opinion: Why I left the Vance Administration, by Tulsi Gabbard | Fox News</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>I’m sure everyone was surprised by my decision to leave the Vance administration after 4 years of being Vice President, none more so than myself. It’s something I tried figuring out myself, since it’s a decision I didn’t quite understand myself, but now, a few months after the fact, I think I have my thoughts sorted out enough to put into words.<br><br>First, I just want to make this clear. There is no drama between JD Vance and I. Vance is a great, confident man who has done a wonderful job in the position of the Oval Office, and I departed on amicable terms. I let him know ahead of time, and I have never seen someone so understanding of my decision to leave. I told him it was nothing personal about his agenda nor his personality, simply just my decision to leave for bigger projects. What those bigger projects were, I wasn’t sure, but now, I think I know.<br><br>I was never comfortable on the right. At the start of my political career, I had always identified more as a Democrat. I am a liberal, and I suspect I always will be. I support wholeheartedly the ability for same-sex couples to get married and believe strongly we need to put an end to the decriminalization of drugs. Climate change is a real crisis, and I am a supporter of any environmentalist policy that works for the interest of all Americans, including the usage of nuclear. I have been and always will be an avid defender of the rights of American Indians, my people.<br><br>But through a combination of progressive purity spiralling, and mainstream media smears, I was forced into a coalition with the right, which I increasingly saw as the last bastions of common sense. They smeared me as a Russian agent, never mind the fact that I had served my country for 16 years, and years of investigations never turned up a single thing. They smeared me as an enemy of the LGBT community, despite my continued advocacy for their equal rights.<br><br>But my home on the political right was temporary. Though I have nothing but respect for the right and their commitment to freedom of speech, systems of merit, and their pragmatic foreign policy. And they have my eternal gratitude for taking me in when I seemed political homeless, I’m just not one of them. With the recent victory of President Vance over Democratic candidate Gavin Newsom, my goal has become clear. Our country can’t thrive if there’s only one real choice, one real party. The Democrats are spiralling, and they’re not going to get better if someone doesn’t save them. We’re better off if America has two sane parties, not just one.<br><br>So I’m coming back to the Democratic Party, and reforming it into a party of American values and common sense. One which will fight for working class families, greener energy, fight big tech monopolies, and promote a unifying, bipartisan agenda that all Americans can agree on. I’m going to get rid of the bureaucratic establishment and the identity politics nonsense that has alienated it from so many Americans, I’m going to turn it back into the Democratic Party I recognize.<br><br>In short, I’m going to Make the Left Great Again.</p>`,
	
	"eugenics": `<h3>Genetically Engineered Billionaires are Reviving Eugenics on the Right | New York Times</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>Transhumanism and Conservatism aren’t two words you’d normally think would go together, but some influential Republican donors, who made their fortunes in the emerging biotechnology field want to change that.<br><br>“I simply don’t see a contradiction between the usage of genetic modification, and the values of the Republican Party.” Viktor Geller, biotech billionaire stated. “We believe in meritocracy; we believe in the ability for individuals to rise to the top of their own merit. If I want to spend my own money to make sure me and my offspring have the best genetics they can, what’s wrong with that?”<br><br>Geller is only one of many right-wing billionaires gathering under the banner of transhumanism, and fighting initiatives to limits IVF, a cause usually championed by the more Christian wing of the party, and has lobbied hard for the Republican Party to advocate for more freedom in experimental genetic technologies.<br><br>“People like to ask me, why aren’t you a liberal? Why don’t I hang around the progressives, maybe they would be more open to your ideas of genetic enhancement, something like that,” Geller said. “Simply put, I can’t be a liberal. Liberals, you see, believe in this idea of equality, when that has never been true. Humans are fundamentally unequal creatures. Life is comprised of fundamentally unequal creatures. The lie of liberalism goes “oh, let us ignore all of the biological differences between peoples”, when we have more and more science that says much of our personalities and capabilities are biologically determined. Transhumanism is a fundamentally right-wing idea,” he says. “Because transhumanism rips the liberal idea of equality to shreds.”<br><br>“I’m not part of the Christian right,” he adds. “All the gay stuff, I don't give a hoot about that. The Christian right, they have this idea that the Bible will lead us to salvation, follow Jesus, and he will lead us to utopia. Bah! That’s just right-wing progressivism. I respect tradition, I understand that we are finite creatures who aren’t as smart as we think we are, and as a result, we should abstain from radical change, I get that. But I think we just have a fundamentally different worldview for what the world looks like.”<br><br>When asked for his own vision of the future, his eyes began to widen, and his voice grew more passionate.<br><br>“I am a believer in the law of Darwin. Natural selection, it is the most iron law in the universe. Those who are weaker die, those who adapt survive. Natural selection dictates that for humanity to evolve and survive, we have to increasingly improve ourselves, spread ourselves among the stars. Transhumanism unlocks the keys to tomorrow, allowing us to improve the gene pool, remove genetic defects, and allow humanity to transcend to the level of gods.”<br><br>When asked whether his ideas were echoing the old, debunked 19th century theories of eugenics, he scoffed, and grew defensive.<br><br>“Bah! All eugenics is, is any policy meant to improve the genetic quality of the human population. The laws you so cherish, that forbid incest between siblings for example is considered eugenics. If you don’t do it with transhumanism now, you will have to do it with natural selection later.  Those who do not adapt will be outcompeted by those who do. I will not throw away the future of humanity for the sake of “feelings”, perpetuating this liberal lie that all men are created equal. Inequality is the reality of life.”<br><br>As the interview ended, he began looking distant, looking out the window we were sitting in to the stars above.<br><br>“Life… It is a funny thing. Billions of years of evolution, and we’re about to finally shatter the glass ceiling that still contains us. I see a future, where humanity is the greatest, strongest version of itself that it can be. A million competing hypotheses, fighting and cooperating however they see fit, to complete the race for the future of life. These stars are the birthright of mankind. One day, they will bow down to us.”</p>`,
	
	"jstark": `<h3>The 3D Printed Firearm Revolution, How American Gun Rights Advocates Plan on Killing Gun Control Forever. | BBC News</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>3D Printed Guns, they’re on the streets, they’re in our homes, and they are entering foreign countries. What started out as a few flimsy “Liberator” pistols has become a full-blown revolution. An entire cottage industry, creating, designing, and printing 3D printed firearms, and exporting the files worldwide for the world to harness.<br><br>Like the name suggests, these firearms are printed from materials from a 3D printer. Often only needing a 3D printer, some spools of plastic, and a digital file, these weapons are by their very nature hard to trace, and hard to crack down on. Leading to many government agencies to decry them as “dangerous”.<br><br>Replicas of the AR-15, FGC-9, and remodelling’s of the AK-47 have found their way used by rebel groups, private military corporations, and terror groups all around the world. America’s lax gun control laws make the creation and export of these files 100% legal, becoming a headache to any other country wanting to limit the spread of these firearms.<br><br>“It’s a New World, it’s a revolution,” said JStark, leader of a group known as “Defense Distributed”, a group dedicated to the creation and distribution of files to make 3D printed firearms. JStark is known to have gotten into a lot of close calls with the law, including one incident with German police he barely survived. “They want to crack down on it, but they’re not going to be able to do it. All you need is a spool of plastic and a 3D printing machine, and an internet connection, how the f--- are you supposed to crack down on that? We've already had billion dollar campaigns to crack down on piracy for decades now. How is this any different?”<br><br>These guns have already contributed to uprisings in Myanmar, insurgencies across the Middle East, and Chechnyan Muslims in Russia. Most notably, they have made their way into Xinjiang, where Uyghur militants have used them to take up arms against the Chinese Communist Party. When asked whether he felt responsibility for the guns that got into evil hands, JStark had this to respond.<br><br>“Where the weapon ends up is not up to me. Guns, weapons, technology, like everything it’s a double edged sword. You’ll never make a weapon that can only be used by the good guys and not the bad. Sure, some bad people will get access to these weapons, but plenty of good people have gotten access to it now. The Uighur Muslims, where do you think they would be if they didn’t have these guns? They were getting killed left and right and nobody did anything man! But now they have a weapon, and once they have a weapon, they have a fighting chance.” JStark said.<br><br>When asked whether his guns could have increased political violence in his own country, with the rise of AfD militancy bringing down German political stability, JStark seemingly doubled down.<br><br>“You either have it or you don’t. You can’t create a weapon only the good guys use and the bad guys don’t. So what if some neo-nazi white supremacist piece of sh— gets a rifle? In this world so do all of the people he wants to hurt. When you give the right to defend to everyone, it’s the people at the bottom who benefit the most,” he said. “Live Free or F---ing Die, there are not just words.”</p>`,

I’ve been a real estate tycoon, a billionaire, a celebrity, a TV star. I’ve become president, and served two beautiful terms. Non-consecutive terms too, only one other person has done that.”<br><br>His voice was no longer that loud, boisterous tone everyone was used to. Instead, was a hushed, softer tone. One which was deeply at peace. “Even secured my legacy with the administration of my Vice President. I’ve raised a beautiful family, so many kids… Barron… He’s my spitting image. One day the kid will grow up just like me, I just know it.”<br><br>Trump’s recording was silent. “I don’t… Know when God is going to come and take me, but when it happens, I feel like I will be ready to go. I’ve lived such a long and wonderful life, doing everything there is for a man to do. I think I’m happy now. Melania… I love you, thank you for being there for the last decades of my life. Eric, Don. Jr, Laura, Tiffany, Barron… You all make me so proud, every single day.”<br><br>“When I go, don’t cry for me. I’ve already done so much and seen so many. But nothing more beautiful than my beautiful children. I’m happy with my life, and playing golf… That was just me enjoying my retirement, knowing I have done everything there is in this life. I can’t wait until I go up to heaven. Heaven is just our next great adventure. Until we see each other again, when time has died, and the gates have closed. Thorn-king beyond, he says hello.”<br><br>And the recording shut off. The body of Trump lay silently, hands folded over his chest, at peace after everything he had done. The crowd was silent, but one man stood up among the crowd. It was Joe Biden, whose complexion was on the verge of tears.<br><br>“I’m going to say it,” Joe Biden said. “I never voted for that b---- Kamala.”<br><br>He paused. “If I knew how badly handing her the keys would f--- up the Democratic Party, I would have kept the bussing segregated.”<br><br>Biden then sat back down, as the casket came to rest in the earth below.</p>`,

	"seastead": `<h3>ReasonTV: The Rise of Seasteading and “Network States”, the Future of Governance?</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>“Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?<br><br>'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.'<br><br>'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.'<br><br>'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.'<br><br>I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different.<br><br>I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture.”<br><br>-Andrew Ryan, Bioshock.<br><br>The idea of setting off and creating your own state, far away from the confines of any existing government has long been a staple of the libertarian imagination, going all the way back to the original pioneers, who set off for the Wild West, looking for new lands to settle. But today, we may be seeing the rise of a new revolution in governance with the rise of the network state.<br><br>The network state, in their own words is “… is a social network with a moral innovation, a sense of national consciousness, a recognized founder, a capacity for collective action, an in-person level of civility, an integrated cryptocurrency, a consensual government limited by a social smart contract, an archipelago of crowdfunded physical territories, a virtual capital, and an on-chain census that proves a large enough population, income, and real estate footprint to attain a measure of diplomatic recognition.” Though not every seastead qualifies as a network state under this definition, “network state” has now become a shorthead for any state whose membership is opt-in and consensual.<br><br>The idea of the consensual state, bound by rules that one can opt-in or opt-out of, is a revolutionary new idea that has begun being implemented with the construction of various seasteads such as Galt’s Gulch, and New Eden. According to one of the leading thinkers of the seasteading movement, the point isn’t that all of these governance projects will be successes, most projects outside of the seasteading world aren’t. But instead:<br><br>“To create competition between governments, to incentivize improvement between governing systems, and to let people vote with their feet.”<br><br>Projects such as the Network State, and the Seasteading Institute have already received large investments from well known billionaires such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who see these projects as a worthwhile investment for the future of humanity. These states often take the form of “seasteads”, floating cities, operating similarly to that of cruise ships, but also in the form of “landsteads”, normally operating in special economic zones across the Global South, bringing in valuable investment to the local economies.<br><br>Even if you don’t plan to live in a seastead, there may be good reason for you to support the seasteading movement, says the founder of the Network State, an organization dedicated to promoting and explaining the concepts behind the network state. Increased competition between governance systems incentivizes other governments to improve. If there was a risk that its top earners could flee to decentralized network states off its shore, how much more likely would the United States be to treat its citizens better? If Chinese billionaires had the ability to flee to seasteads off their shore, how would China treat its citizens differently?<br><br>“Ultimately, whether you love it, hate it, or something in between, the idea of a network state is a new experiment. Our world is facing a myriad of crises, from climate change, population collapse, and financial overregulation. And though a lot of experiments fail, if we’re going to find ways to adapt to this changing world, we need a lot of new experimentation.”</p>`,

What is a private military corporation, and what will be their impact on the future of geopolitics?<br><br>A private military corporation is any private military or security company providing armed combat or security services in exchange for profit. They’ve become increasingly large with the fragmentation of the global order, weakening of the nation state, and the proliferation of 3D printed firearms. PMCs are normally operated in a more developed country, usually a major power or superpower, and then hire people from more undeveloped regions to work as their armed contractors.<br><br>These PMCs can pay a wage much higher than the indigenous wage offered in these countries, making them a highly desired and lucrative offer for seasoned soldiers from these countries. They’re often staffed by officers from their home country, guaranteeing a certain degree of loyalty to the home country.<br><br>They have gained much political power, with the Association of American Mercenaries, or AAM becoming one of the Republican Party’s biggest lobbying groups. They often advertise themselves as a partner to American isolationism, privatizing global intervention rather than laying it on the hands of the taxpayer. Critics say that PMCs are responsible for numerous human rights violations and are not held accountable to the rules of international law.<br><br>These tensions have come to a boil with the recent PMC operations in Latin America, overthrowing various governments and leading many to escalate their critics from a critic of human rights violations, to saying that they are a threat to the idea of a monopoly on violence.<br><br>“Look, a nation state is an entity that has exclusive control over a certain geographically defined region or territory. They have the ability to enforce laws and regulations. That is what a state is, “a monopoly on violence”. But here you see the rise of private military corporations who have the ability to supersede the state’s natural right to enforce their laws inside their borders. This is a critical threat to anyone who supports rule of law, and supports freedom and democracy around the globe,” said one prominent political scientist, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br><br>Increasing various countries, Nicaragua, Guinea, Venezuela, and now most recently, Haiti have become what political scientists have called “mercenary states”. Countries that have been taken over by American mercenaries, and have become a safe haven of operations for other PMCs looking to do illicit or otherwise unsavory activities. Despite widespread condemnation from the United Nations, the continued support these activities receive from the United States makes them hard to sanction.<br><br>With the fact that these groups are often well trained and heavily armed, and now having the resources of a state to draw from, it has become increasingly hard and unlikely that these mercenary states will be toppled.<br><br>It should be noted that while American mercenaries are the most prevalent, they are not even close to the only countries which allow and implicitly encourage private military corporations. With Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Turkey only being some of the countries that use private military groups to conduct covert operations on behalf of their national self interest, in what some call a neo-colonial strategy of new oppression against the Global South. With dozens more operating independently with their own goals and ideological motives.</p>`,
	
	"malcolm": `<h3>Transcript: Pro Natalism, the Right’s New Trend? An interview with Malcolm Collins | Politico</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll; height:270px;'><p>(Begin Interview)<br><br>Interviewer: So, the way we understand it, you are one of the leading voices behind the growing pro-natalist movement on the right. But you’ve also been vocal that the decline of worldwide fertility rates is a bad thing, can you elaborate on that?<br><br>Malcolm Collins: Look, I know most of your readers are progressives, so let me make this as clear to you as I possibly can. If you are not having kids, your ideology will go extinct. Anyone who is not having 3 or more kids is going to be eliminated out of the gene pool. What I am trying to do is to create a technophilic, generationally durable alliance of pluralistic cultures that can survive long term. Because currently the only group that is able to have above replacement fertility rates are the technophobic fundamentalist religious cultures. And I just want people to understand, that is going to be the entire voterbase in a few generations. <br><br>Interviewer: You’ve recently attracted some skepticism for the statement that the 2032 elections were a “pivotal turning point” for all of human civilization. Can you elaborate what you mean by that?<br><br>Malcolm Collins: What we just saw in the 2032 elections was the final fall of the progressive urban monoculture. We’ve seen their ejection from power. Already, you have people like Tulsi Gabbard make a play to take over the left. People like Tulsi Gabbard are going to be the people in charge of the new left. This memetic virus that has taken over the academic institutions? They’re done, they’re finished. They have the single lowest fertility rate of any population group of on earth. What I think is going to happen is that we’re going to see the end of this Progressive Détente, where the progressive urban monoculture forced everyone to get along. Now with the Détente over, we’re going to see the rise of cultural competition again. And a lot of people are going to end up perishing in the next few centuries because of that. It’s tough, but it is what needs to happen for humanity to continue to evolve.<br><br>Interviewer: 25% of all liberal women identify as “child-free”, how do they factor into your vision of the future?<br><br>Malcolm Collins: They don’t. Bye bye!<br><br>Interviewer: Do you believe human worth is solely defined by reproduction, or do you see value in ideas, contributions, and legacies that transcend birthrates?<br><br>Malcolm Collins: Human worth is determined by long term cultural sustainability, and the progressives have none. Imagine a conservative seeing a progressive, and going “hey, these people have no kids, are chronically depressed, are mentally ill, and their society is headed for extinction. Let’s copy them!”. Said no one ever.<br><br>Interviewer: How do you reconcile a focus on birthrates with the principles of human dignity and the diverse ways people choose to contribute to society?<br><br>Malcolm Collins: I don’t. If your culture can’t motivate high fertility rates, then you can only grow by parasitizing people from other cultures, which is how the progressive mindvirus did it. And conservatives are now building their own education systems, look at American Academy, look at Freedom Universities, look at the Collins Institute, so good luck with that. If you want to contribute to a future that your genes and your kids have no right to, and literally be a cuck, I mean go on ahead. It’s going to be the kids of conservatives that end up benefitting.<br><br>Interviewer: Is it morally justifiable to reduce an entire ideological group’s value to their capacity for reproduction?<br><br>Malcolm Collins (Looking visibly tired): Yes.<br><br>Interviewer: Does your concern about progressive birthrates stem from a genuine interest in their well-being or an attempt to marginalize their values?<br><br>Malcolm Collins: I’ve been trying to warn them for years now. At this point I’m just rubbing it in, because we told them and they didn't listen.<br><br>Interviewer: Are you suggesting that ideological merit is determined by demographics rather than the strength and adaptability of ideas?<br><br>Malcolm Collins: … I think I just lost all motivation to continue this interview. If you have any further questions, please direct them to MalcolmGPT bot. I’m going to go back to work.<br><br>Interviewer: Do you think there is any possibilities where childless people are granted equal status to those who have large families?<br><br>MalcolmGPT: I'm sorry, but as an AI assistant, I strive to maintain a respectful and helpful environment. I cannot engage with questions that might be degrading to intellectual discourse. Please feel free to ask something constructive or try again.</p>`,
